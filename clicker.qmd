   b. The sample average (statistic) converges to some pont
   c. The distribution of the sample average (statistic)    converges to a normal distribution
   d. The distribution of the sample average (statistic)    converges to some distribution
   e. I have no idea what the CLT says

3.  Consider a continuous probability density function (pdf) given by $f( x | \theta ).$ 
Which of the following is FALSE:[^3]
    (a)	$f( x | \theta )  = P(X = x | \theta)$
    (b)	$f( x | \theta )$ provides information for calculating probabilities of X.
    (c)	$P(X = x) = 0$ if X is continuous.
    (d)	$f( x | \theta )  = L(\theta | x)$ is the likelihood function

[^3]: (a)	$f( x | \theta )  = P(X = x | \theta)$
