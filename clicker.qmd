1. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says:[^1]
   a. The sample average (statistic) converges to the true   average (parameter)
   b. The sample average (statistic) converges to some point
   c. The distribution of the sample average (statistic) converges to a normal distribution
   d. The distribution of the sample average (statistic) converges to some distribution
   e. I have no idea what the CLT says
   

[^1]:  c. The distribution of the sample average (statistic) converges to a normal distribution

2. Which cab company was involved (see example 2.2 in the notes)?[^2]

    (b) Sort of likely the Blue Cab company
    (c) Equally likely Blue and Green Cab companies
    (d) Sort of likely the Green Cab company
    (e) Very likely the Green Cab company

[^2]: (d) Sort of likely the Green Cab company

3.  Consider a continuous probability density function (pdf) given by $f( x | \theta ).$ 
Which of the following is FALSE:[^3]
    (a)	$f( x | \theta )  = P(X = x | \theta)$
    (b)	$f( x | \theta )$ provides info for calculating probabilities of X.
    (c)	$P(X = x) = 0$ if X is continuous.
    (d)	$f( x | \theta )  = L(\theta | x)$ is the likelihood function

[^3]: (a)	$f( x | \theta )  = P(X = x | \theta)$

4. To find a marginal distribution **of X** from a joint distribution **of X & Y** you should (assume everything is continuous),[^4]
    (a) differentiate the joint distribution with respect to X.
    (b) differentiate the joint distribution with respect to Y.
    (c) integrate the joint distribution with respect to X.
    (d) integrate the joint distribution with respect to Y.
    (e) I have no idea what a marginal distribution is.
    
[^4]: (d) integrate the joint distribution with respect to Y.

5. A continuous pdf (of a random variable $X$ with parameter $\theta$) should[^5]
   (a) Integrate to a constant ($dx$)
   (b) Integrate to a constant ($d\theta$)
   (c) Integrate to 1 ($dx$)
   (d) Integrate to 1 ($d\theta$)
   (e) not need to integrate to anything special.

[^5]: (c) Integrate to 1 ($dx$)

6. R / R Studio
   (a) all good
   (b) started, progress is slow and steady
   (c) started, very stuck
   (d) haven’t started yet
   (e) what do you mean by "R"?

---

7. In terms of the R for the homework…
   (a) I was able to do the whole thing.
   (b) I understood the code part, but I couldn’t get the Markdown file to compile.
   (c) I didn’t understand the code at all.
   (d) I couldn’t get R or R Studio installed.
   (e) I haven't tried to work on the homework yet.

8.  A beta distribution[^8]
    (a) has support on [0,1]
    (b) has parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which represent, respectively, the mean and variance
    (c) is discrete
    (d) has equal mean and variance
    (e) has equal mean and standard deviation
  
[^8]: (a) has support on [0,1]

9.  What types of distributions are the following?[^9]
    (a) prior = marginal    & posterior = joint
    (b) prior = joint       & posterior = conditional
    (c) prior = conditional & posterior = joint
    (d) prior = marginal    & posterior = conditional
    (e) prior = joint       & posterior = marginal 

[^9]: (d) prior = marginal & posterior = conditional

10. Which of these are incorrect conclusions?[^10]
    (a) $\theta | \underline{X} \sim$ Beta (4,12)
    (b) $\xi(\theta | \underline{X}) \sim$  Beta (4,12)
    (c) $\xi(\theta | \underline{X}) \propto$ Beta (4,12)
    (d) $\xi(\theta | \underline{X}) \propto \theta^{4-1} (1-\theta)^{12-1}$
    (e) $\xi(\theta | \underline{X}) = \frac{1}{B(4,12)} \theta^{4-1}(1-\theta)^{12-1}$ 
   
[^10]: Both (b) $\xi(\theta | \underline{X}) \sim$  Beta (4,12) and (c) $\xi(\theta | \underline{X}) \propto$ Beta (4,12) are incorrect.  (b) because the value to the left of the $\sim$ must be a random variable.  (c) because the value to the right of the $\propto$ must be a function.

11. What is the integrating constant for the pdf, $h(w)$?[^11]
    (a) $\frac{\Gamma(w+k)}{\Gamma(w)\Gamma(k)}$
    (b) 1/[$w^k \Gamma(k)$]
    (c) 1 / $\sqrt{2\pi k^2}$
    (d) 1/[$\Gamma(k/2)$]
    (e) 1/[$2^{k/2} \Gamma(k/2)$]

$$h(w) \propto w^{k/2-1}e^{-w/2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ w>0$$

[^11]: (e) 1/[$2^{k/2} \Gamma(k/2)$]
