Each week, follow the general process outlined below:\n\nEnjoy the notes / text \nAttend class, review the warm-up and solutions if you have any questions after completing it during class.\nComplete the HW assignment ( pdf &  Rmd linked below),  submit the assignment via Gradescope accessed on the course Canvas site.\nDiscuss the reflection questions  and ethics considerations  (see the  class notes) with your classmates, mentor, and professor.\nThe textbook is Probability and Statistics (P&S), by DeGroot and Schervish (either 3rd or 4th edition is fine).
